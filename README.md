# Public-Transport-System
  This project can extract information about stations and lines of public transport system, given database in certain format.
  
  Firstly, two options are given. One of them is to end the execution of a program (0) and the other is to load files (.txt format) that contain information about stations and lines (1). Option (0) is always available. There are default files which are loaded in case someone doesn't write from which file he wants to load his data.
  
  Next, one can either request informations about stations (1), request informations about line (2) or find a path between two stations (3).
If the first one is chosen, one needs to insert a label of station, and the file with available informations is made.
The same goes for the second option.

  Lastly, if one wants to find a path between two stations, he can do it in a various ways. He can request the following:
  1. The shortest path
  2. The path that contains the least number of changing of lines
  3. The path that goes through all the importatnt stations
     
  The file with needed instructions on how to get to the wanted station is made.
The process can be repeated as many times as one wants. Loading a new databases is possible, but **it will delete the existing one!**
